# Final Project Part 3- the final story
[American seniors are living longer, but are they living better?](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/fmisbah/index.html)

## My process

The insights from the user research helped me focus my story, as it was a bit high-level before. My focus was on the cost of healthcare and the disproportionate financial burden on the elderly population. This was done visually through pie charts. I also discussed the state of lhc in America to further persuade the reader on the problem. Then presented actionable, effective call to action along with some goals to direct the reader towards using the CTA tool effectively.
Converted some stats into visuals to create interest. Removed years very old data frok the population growth dataset as per professorâ€™s critique
As per critiques, discussed some specific goals to conclude my story and added a simple, effective CTA 
Refined visuals further, converted a pie chart to a proportion graphic, changed rhe colours, added some labels etc
The audience for my final story were policy professionals and students"
For my final story, I made some edits based on the insights I gathered from the interviews during the user research and feedback from the professor. The three key areas I focused on were:
- Story arc: One of the critiques I recieved was that my story could use more focus- it was a bit high-level before, discussing broadly three or four problematic areas in LHC. So, I focused my story on the two key problems that seniors in long-term healthcare (LHC) face: the costs of LHC and the disproportionate financial burden on the elderly population, and the substandard quality of care provided in LHC facilities across the US. 
- Visuals: After preparing the draft in Part 2, I felt that some of the statistics could be presented through more interesting viasuals, so I changed one of the pie charts (percentage of elderly Americans needing LHC) to a more engaging visualization that can be seen in my story.
Based on the feedback from the professor, I focused the timeline for the population growth of elderly Americans from a 100 years to the last 20 years. That definitely helped highlight the sharp rise in the elderly population in the past 20 years.
Other thant that, I played around with the colours, labels and titles and placement of my visualizations to achieve a more streamlined flow to my story.
- Call-to-action: At the end of my story, I concluded with an effective and actionable call-to-action that prompts the reader to use the National Council on Aging's Advocacy tool where people can reach out to representatives in Congress with solid, actionable demands to protect seniors and strengthen the programs established for their welfare. I also added some goals along with the Call-To-Action to guide the reader to using the tool effectively.

I intend for my story to reach everyone, as we all have elderly loved ones that we care about, and well, nobody's getting any younger! However, the target audience for my story are policy professionals especially working at the intersection of policy and healthcare, now or in the future.
